Algorithm:


1. Splitting the entire file by a space, and combining all the words.


2. Traversing through all the words and making the pairs of each consecutive words.

3. Mapping the pairs of words as the ring and their values as 1.


4. Combining all the same word pairs with the number of time they occur in the document.

5. In reducer,counting the total word pairs of the particular word and adding it to a TreeSet with both the words of that pair and their relative frequency.

6. Writing the top 100 results in an output file.
